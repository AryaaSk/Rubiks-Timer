# A simple timer to time Rubiks cube solves, trying to replicate a stackmat timer using a Mac Touchpad

**This is different from other times due to the fact that instead of holding the space bar or another key to start the timer, it uses the inbuilt trackpad on a Mac.**

## To build
Add a reference to the [dist](Web/dist) folder in the xcode project, then build in xcode.

## Usage
- To start the timer just hold both hands on either end of the trackpad, wait for the timer to turn green, then let go.
- To stop the timer just press both hands on either end of the trackpad when you are finished.
